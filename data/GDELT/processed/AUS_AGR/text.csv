2023-04-17 09:15:00,AUS_AGR,"New research from the Dairy Feedbase program at Ellinbank SmartFarm highlights that milking order significantly impacts milk yield, with cows milked earlier producing 5-6 liters more daily than those milked later. Strategies such as reserving fresh pasture for later cows and adjusting grain allocation—feeding more grain to cows milked later—have improved overall herd milk production without additional resources. For example, the farm increased yields by over 1 liter per cow through pasture management, and by 0.8 liters per cow by optimizing grain distribution. These findings suggest that herd management practices focusing on milking order and feed allocation can enhance milk output, especially in larger herds. Ongoing efforts aim to refine these strategies across different farms to maximize productivity."

Queensland fishers, like Neil Green, defend gillnet fishing against conservation groups, citing evidence that their methods do not harm bycatch species such as dugongs and turtles. The Australian Marine Conservation Society promotes farmed seafood and discourages wild-caught prawns and barramundi caught in Queensland waters, which industry representatives argue undermines local fishing communities. Recent legislation banning gillnet fishing in the Gulf of Carpentaria has been contested by the industry, emphasizing the importance of supporting local, wild-caught seafood for economic and cultural reasons. The industry advocates for government support to reverse restrictive laws and promote sustainable fishing practices."
2024-12-20 05:00:00,AUS_AGR,"Small-scale farmers, like Pat Carmody in New South Wales, are concerned about proposed new food regulations that will require licensing and inspections for leafy greens, melons, and berries, potentially threatening their businesses. The regulations aim to improve food safety following outbreaks of foodborne illness but are considered disproportionate and costly for small producers. Carmody argues that his direct-to-consumer supply chain minimizes contamination risks, and the new rules could make his business unviable. Other farmers and market organizers worry that the regulations could reduce small-scale farming and community markets, which are vital for local economies and food security. The NSW Food Authority has opened a consultation period to gather community feedback before finalizing the rules."
2024-12-26 00:45:00,AUS_AGR,"The article discusses challenges faced by South Australian agriculture in early 2024, including weather interruptions delaying harvests and damaging crops and infrastructure. Farmers expressed concerns over the potential impacts of a 'live sheep by sea' export ban, and efforts are underway to grow agritourism, with the state government establishing a working group to boost the sector by $200 million by 2025. Crop yields declined from 9.2 million tonnes to 8.7 million tonnes due to persistent rain, affecting crop quality and farm profits. Infrastructure projects received funding, such as upgrades to the Yorke Peninsula roads to support the agriculture industry. Additionally, the livestock market showed signs of recovery at Beef Week, despite high temperatures affecting attendance."
2024-12-26 21:00:00,AUS_AGR,"Longwarry farmers Sharon and Chris Jordan have been engaged in a nearly 15-year legal and regulatory battle over flooding, water flow, and development issues affecting their farm, including damage caused by local drainage and infill development that altered water runoff and caused flooding on their property. The flooding has severely impacted their cattle operation, leading to livestock losses, soil damage, and restrictions on selling pedigree cattle due to disease concerns. Development activities and changes to land use have increased water-related risks, including flooding and water quality issues that threaten biosecurity, particularly related to Johne's disease risks from neighboring cattle operations. The Jordans allege insufficient planning and infrastructure management by local authorities and Melbourne Water have exacerbated these problems, jeopardizing their farm's sustainability and future, including export market access. Local authorities report ongoing efforts to address drainage and flooding concerns, emphasizing the importance of agricultural zones for regional food production."
2024-12-27 00:00:00,AUS_AGR,"Longwarry farmers, Sharon and Chris Jordan, have battled for nearly 15 years with local authorities and developers over flooding, water management, and land development issues that have severely impacted their farm and cattle operations. Flooding caused by unmaintained waterways and new residential infill has damaged their soil, limited cattle grazing, and threatened their ability to maintain disease-free pedigree cattle, hindering market opportunities. The Jordans claim development activities and poor planning have altered natural water flow, increasing flooding and water contamination risks, and have led to personal threats and harassment. Their efforts to address these issues include challenging infilling works and seeking intervention from water authorities, with concerns about inadequate planning and water management from local council. The ongoing disputes have jeopardized the Jordans' farm sustainability and inheritance plans for future generations."
2024-12-30 03:15:00,AUS_AGR,"The article discusses the increasing interest in renewable energy projects on agricultural land in Australia and emphasizes the importance of landholder negotiations and protections. It highlights the role of tools like the Renewable Energy Landholder Toolkit, developed by the Queensland Farmers Federation, to assist farmers in understanding their options and key considerations. Legal and financial advice from specialists is essential for landholders to secure fair agreements, with attention to lease terms, environmental impacts, and the project's operational scope. The article also notes that project development depends on factors like permits, community support, and environmental assessments, and stresses the importance of ongoing awareness of local developments. Overall, it underscores the need for farmers to carefully evaluate potential impacts and their negotiations with renewable energy companies."
