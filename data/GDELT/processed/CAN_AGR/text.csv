Experts emphasize the importance of government support for farmers, including affordable land access and sustainable farming policies, to ensure long-term food security. There is concern over increasing foreign and corporate ownership of farmland, which may prioritize profit over long-term agricultural sustainability."
2022-07-29 00:30:00,CAN_AGR,"Some farmers in Ontario are blaming the Canadian government for increased fertilizer costs due to a 35% tariff on Russian fertilizer, which has risen from $400 to over $1,000 per metric tonne. This tariff, imposed amidst ongoing geopolitical conflicts, makes fertilizer more expensive, impacting crop yields and potentially raising grocery prices. Farmers, like Leo Gilbeault, express concerns that the higher costs reduce fertilizer use, resulting in smaller yields and less food production. The government has announced investments in the fertilizer industry and efforts to find new suppliers, but farmers remain worried about the ongoing impact of high fertilizer prices. Gilbeault questions why Canada is the only G7 country to impose such a tariff and advocates for its removal."
2022-08-10 05:30:00,CAN_AGR,"The Canadian government aims to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, leading to concerns among farmers and industry groups about potential reductions in crop yields and income. Farmers already use the efficient ""4R system"" to minimize fertilizer use and costs, and many feel the emissions reduction target was set without prior consultation or detailed analysis. The target was imposed by the Environment Ministry, influenced by Greenpeace, despite evidence that Canada’s fertilizer use per hectare is lower than many other countries. Farmers emphasize their willingness to improve practices but feel disconnected from government policies that seem to impose restrictions without dialogue. Industry representatives suggest the government should engage more with the farming community to address concerns and promote sustainable practices collaboratively."
2022-08-11 02:15:00,CAN_AGR,"The Canadian government aims to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, sparking opposition from farmers and industry groups who prefer intensity-based reductions. Farmers already practice the 4R system (right source, right rate, right time, right place) to optimize fertilizer use, and recent price hikes have further incentivized reductions. Industry representatives criticize the 30% target for lacking prior consultation, modeling, or analysis, and note it was imposed by the Environment Ministry rather than agriculture authorities. Canada’s fertilizer use per hectare is relatively low compared to other countries, indicating efficient use, but industry concerns center around the economic impact and government communication. Ultimately, farmers feel disregarded and call for more dialogue with policymakers to address their concerns."

2022-09-02 12:30:00,CAN_AGR,"The Alberta government has implemented bounty and trapping programs to control the invasive feral pig population, offering rewards for proof of kills, but no bounties have been claimed in five months. Experts warn that hunting may exacerbate the problem by dispersing the pigs and making them more elusive, favoring trapping as a more effective method. Feral pigs, including Eurasian wild boar and hybrids, cause significant ecological and agricultural damage by trampling habitats, damaging crops, contaminating water, and spreading diseases. The previous bounty program from 2008 to 2017 resulted in over 1,000 pig kills, but interest waned, and the program was eventually shut down, as hunting could make population control more difficult. Local breeders, such as Earl Hagman, raise and hunt captive wild boars but have noted a lack of wild boars in the area, emphasizing the challenge in locating and managing the invasive species."
