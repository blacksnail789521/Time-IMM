2020-09-08,"Proposed U.S. export restrictions on SMIC threaten to disrupt China's domestic semiconductor supply chain and negatively impact American and Japanese companies that supply SMIC, such as Applied Materials, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron. The restrictions could prevent these suppliers from selling advanced manufacturing equipment to SMIC, hindering its ability to produce high-end chips and potentially forcing Chinese firms to rely on foreign foundries like TSMC. Shares of Chinese equipment providers like Naura and AMEC declined as a result, while Taiwanese firms like Winbond and Macronix saw their share prices rise amid potential opportunities. The restrictions could also lead to increased costs and delays for Chinese chip companies, complicating efforts to advance independent semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Overall, these measures risk significantly affecting both the Chinese semiconductor industry and global supply chains.",AMAT
2020-09-11,"Ambarella's stock has decreased by 22% since the start of the year, but its valuation metrics suggest potential downside. Despite a 35% stock increase since early 2019, revenues declined by 22%, adversely affecting profitability and reducing EPS from $0.57 in 2018 to -$1.35 in 2020. The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio peaked at 8.7x in 2019 and has since decreased to 6.8x amid declining margins and revenues, with further contraction expected if current trends persist. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused demand drops for computing devices and increased competition, leading to lower revenues and potentially lower stock prices, possibly down to $40 if the P/S multiple drops to around 6x. Overall, the analysis indicates significant downside risk for Ambarella’s stock in the medium term.",AMAT

2020-09-16,"U.S. companies supplying equipment to China's semiconductor industry, represented by SEMI, oppose the proposed blacklist of SMIC, China’s top chipmaker, arguing it would harm U.S. industry and market share. The potential addition of SMIC to the Commerce Department’s ""entity list"" could restrict U.S. exports worth approximately $5 billion annually and damage U.S. technological leadership. The move is part of broader U.S. efforts to scrutinize Chinese firms for national security concerns, particularly relating to China’s military connections. Shares of SMIC plummeted nearly 25% following reports of the possible blacklist. The industry group warns that such measures could undermine U.S. economic and strategic interests.",AMAT
2020-09-22,"Qualcomm's stock has increased by approximately 32% year-to-date, driven by a 9% revenue growth and an 18% reduction in outstanding shares, resulting in a 33% rise in revenue per share. Despite the recent gains, the stock's valuation multiple (P/S ratio) has risen from 3.9x in 2017 to 5.7x currently, which is above its historical range and poses downside risk. The global COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted smartphone demand and delayed 5G launches, likely reducing Qualcomm’s chipset sales in the near term, although licensing revenue is expected to recover due to a renewed Apple licensing deal. Analysts anticipate that Qualcomm's upcoming financial results will confirm the revenue and profit decline, and if virus containment remains uncertain, the stock could fall to around $100 as its P/S ratio decreases.
