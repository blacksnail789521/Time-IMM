Priceline's revenue primarily comes from hotel bookings, with smaller contributions from air tickets, advertising, and cash reserves. The company's growth prospects are linked to increasing international market penetration and share gains in hotel bookings. However, heightened competition from firms like Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity presents downside risks, especially if Priceline's market share in hotel bookings only reaches 2.5% rather than the projected 3%, which could result in a 12% decrease in its stock value.

Despite reduced commissions from airlines and efforts to lower distribution costs, online travel agencies continue to focus on booking airline tickets to upsell other travel products such as hotels and car rentals. The market share of online travel agencies is projected to grow from under 40% today to around 45% in five years, but this could fluctuate based on whether airlines decide to offer additional services through third-party channels.

The company's proprietary Name Your Own Price service allows flexible travelers to bid for discounted hotel and air services, benefiting both consumers and suppliers. Despite increasing competition from airline websites expanding their own offerings, Priceline’s focus on hotel bookings and international markets provides a competitive edge. The article suggests that forming partnerships with airlines to offer hotel bookings on their sites could significantly boost Priceline’s market share and stock value—potentially by 29% if hotel market share increases from 2% to 4%.

The company has expanded its international presence through key acquisitions of Booking.com and Agoda, which strengthen its foothold in Europe and Asia.

The company acquired Agoda in 2007, strengthening its presence in the Asian market, where nearly 60% of bookings now come from.

The online travel industry faces intensifying competition from airlines and hotel chains offering direct booking, leading to squeezed revenue margins for online travel agencies. Despite lower profit margin assumptions, Trefis maintains a valuation of Expedia's stock at $29.12, with hotel bookings and TripAdvisor accounting for the majority of the company's value. Expedia's improved Egencia corporate travel services, rising from below 8% to over 12%, contribute modestly to total revenues and are unlikely to significantly impact overall profits.

2011-03-09,"Priceline's stock increased by about 85% last year, driven by a 47% growth in bookings from $9.3 billion to $13.6 billion, with international bookings increasing by 67%. The company's revenue margin slightly declined from 25.1% to 22.6%, yet revenue grew by 32% to $3 billion in 2010. A significant share of growth came from expanding hotel bookings outside the U.S., which have higher profit margins over air ticket bookings. Priceline improved its EBITDA margin from 23.6% to 29.2%, benefiting from increased bookings and acquisitions like TravelJigsaw. Despite positive growth, challenges such as economic recovery, geopolitical instability, and rising oil prices could impact future earnings.",EXPE

Despite this, Expedia maintains strong financial health with EBITDA margins nearing 30%, significant free cash flow exceeding $500 million annually, and over $1.2 billion in cash reserves. The company is actively repurchasing shares, contemplating dividend hikes, and investing heavily in international expansion, which may temper short-term profit growth but position it for future gains.

Strategic developments, including improved relations with AMR and growing ancillary revenue streams, are expected to enhance Expedia's valuation in coming quarters.",EXPE
2011-03-31,"Expedia derives nearly 41% of its business internationally, with significant growth potential in Asia Pacific, despite a small online travel market share in Japan. The company's hotel bookings segment, over 55% of its valuation at $29.12, faces risks from Japan's recent crises, which may lower occupancy rates and impact revenue. A potential slowdown in tourism due to regional issues could decrease Expedia's stock value by approximately 5%.

Gogobot's integration of social networking, partnerships with major online travel agencies, and user-friendly interface could decrease traffic and advertising revenues for Expedia's TripAdvisor, which constitutes approximately 23% of its stock value, estimated at $29.12. The reduction in visitor flow and advertising earnings could significantly affect Expedia's overall revenue and stock value. To counter this threat, Expedia must defend its market position against Gogobot's growing user engagement and social features.

2011-04-09,"Priceline's stock valuation primarily derives from its hotel bookings, which account for 91% of its value, while air travel bookings contribute less than 2%. The company's revenue is based on charging a percentage of booking values, influenced by factors such as average airfares, commission rates, and market share in air ticket bookings. Despite air travel generating over two-thirds of online bookings and essential traffic, its contribution to revenue is declining due to increased competition, lower commissions, and decreasing average airfares. These competitive pressures have caused margins in air travel bookings to shrink, although there has been some recent improvement. Overall, Priceline's profitability and stock valuation are heavily weighted toward its dominance in hotel bookings rather than air travel.",EXPE

TripAdvisor, which generates significant revenue from advertising, accounts for roughly 24% of Expedia's valuation, with an implied value of around $1.9 billion, potentially rising to $4 billion post-spin-off. The separation is aimed at allowing each business to focus on its core operations—Expedia on travel bookings and TripAdvisor on media—while unlocking shareholder value. The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and may provide Expedia shareholders with substantial gains, given the increased valuation potential.

Travelzoo's revenue is primarily generated through advertising fees, and its Local Deals business has significant growth potential, aiming for $780 million annually with expansion to 200 global markets. The stock trades at a high forward P/E ratio of around 50 based on 2012 earnings estimates of $1.70 per share, but it remains attractive for investors looking for growth after a recent dip below its high.

Priceline, with less than 2% of its stock value tied to air ticket bookings, remains relatively unaffected by regional travel declines, while Expedia is more vulnerable due to its 10% reliance on air bookings. Despite tourism drops in countries like Egypt, Lebanon, and Bahrain, there has been a shift of travelers to safer destinations like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which have increased hotel capacity significantly.
