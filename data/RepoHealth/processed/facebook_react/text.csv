2025-04-11,facebook/react,"The discussions primarily revolve around handling autofill events in React, highlighting browser-specific behaviors and bugs, especially in Chrome on iOS, Safari, and other browsers, which cause autofill values not to trigger React's `onChange` or `input` events reliably. Several solutions involve polling input values, dispatching manual synthetic events, or hacking with CSS pseudo-classes and animation events to detect autofill, but these are often inconsistent and fragile. There is concern that browser security policies intentionally prevent React from accessing autofilled values upon page load, complicating controlled component synchronization. Additionally, there are debates about React's deprecation of `defaultProps` in function components and the implications for backward compatibility and component design. Overall, there's a consensus that handling autofill in React remains a complex, browser-dependent problem with no fully reliable, standardized solution."
2025-04-12,facebook/react,"The discussions primarily revolve around size variations and optimization practices in React builds, with specific attention to critical bundle size changes and their impact. There is a concern about size increases in external store implementations and React reconciler components, some exceeding 2%, prompting considerations for size management and code refactoring. A specific technical question addresses the handling of the `useSyncExternalStore` API, including the correct usage of dependencies and ref management to satisfy linting rules and improve code clarity. Additionally, questions are raised about the build process's handling of built-in APIs, particularly the necessity of the `unstable_` prefix for React's external store support. Overall, the discussions seek to identify ways to optimize bundle sizes while maintaining code clarity and API correctness."
2025-04-14,facebook/react,"The discussions highlight significant concerns with React 19's default automatic form reset behavior, which conflicts with typical user expectations and complicates server-side validation workflows, especially when preserving input state during validation errors. Developers suggest various workarounds, such as using `onSubmit` with `preventDefault()`, returning original `FormData` in server responses, or re-rendering forms with keys, but these approaches introduce complexity and limitations, notably with controlled components and certain input types like `<select>` and `<file>`. There is a call for React to provide an opt-in configuration or a dedicated property to control form resetting behavior directly, enabling developers to choose whether to reset or persist form data across submissions. Additionally, there are broader questions about React's internal hook design—particularly `useConst` and `useState` stability—and how to balance framework simplicity with the flexibility required for complex, real-world form handling. Overall, the community urges React and Next.js to improve form state management options to better align with user experience expectations and practical development needs."
2025-04-15,facebook/react,"The primary concern across these discussions revolves around React's handling of form state and input persistence, especially with the introduction of React 19's automatic form reset behavior, which conflicts with user expectations for retaining input values after validation errors or server responses. Several proposed solutions include leveraging `defaultValue` with server-returned data, wrapping `setSelectionRange` calls in `setTimeout`, or managing form state manually via controlled components and custom validation schemas like Zod. There is a recurring call for React to provide a built-in, flexible option (e.g., an `option` attribute) to control whether forms should reset or preserve data upon submission, as current default behaviors can break user experience in real-world scenarios such as editing drafts or handling server-side validation errors. Unresolved questions include how to seamlessly support both controlled and uncontrolled inputs with the new default behaviors, especially for complex input types like `<select>` and `<file>`, and whether the React team will introduce official APIs or configurations to make form reset/persist behavior configurable."
2025-04-16,facebook/react,"The discussions highlight that external DOM modifications, such as those from Google Translate and browser extensions, can break React applications by invalidating React's node references, leading to errors like ""Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'"". Common workaround strategies include wrapping text in `<span>` tags, disabling translation with `translate=""no""`, or adding unique React `key` props to mitigate re-rendering issues. There is concern that React cannot fully resolve these issues internally because they stem from external DOM mutations that violate React's assumptions, especially in dynamic translation scenarios. Some suggest monitoring DOM mutations via `MutationObserver` or introducing global patches as potential, though imperfect, workarounds, while unresolved questions focus on whether React could detect or better handle incompatible external DOM changes. Ultimately, the consensus is that preventing external manipulations or disabling translation for specific elements is the most reliable approach until underlying browser/extension behaviors are improved."
2025-04-17,facebook/react,"The discussions highlight that React's rules of hooks restrict calling hooks within class components and static class methods, leading some contributors to seek custom or static hooks, which are discouraged by the React team to ensure deterministic hook execution. Several contributors suggest the possibility of relaxing this restriction, especially for static class methods, and propose dedicated linter rules or configuration options to accommodate such patterns. Additionally, there are concerns about the trade-offs of React's emphasis on top-level function hooks versus class-based coding styles, with some arguing that the current restrictions limit flexibility and obscure JavaScript's class namespace conventions. Unresolved questions include whether deeper reasons underpin these restrictions beyond code consistency, and how best to balance React's deterministic hook rules with diverse coding patterns, especially in complex applications or custom architectures."
2025-04-18,facebook/react,"The discussions raise concerns about React's lifecycle handling, particularly the timing and reliability of refs during effects, especially when observing DOM elements, with suggestions to set up observers within ref callbacks for stability. There's an ongoing question about whether React internally tracks dependency changes in `useEffect` to identify what triggered the effect, as current workarounds involve manual previous value tracking, which may be inefficient or complex. Some comments highlight unexpected behaviors or regressions in ref attachment and lifecycle processes, emphasizing the need for React to handle such scenarios more gracefully. The conversations also include procedural requests for contributors, specifically regarding signing the CLA before pull request merges. Overall, unresolved questions focus on React's internal mechanisms for dependency change detection and ref attachment timing, seeking more transparent or automatic solutions."
2025-04-19,facebook/react,"The comments indicate that a contributor named ShuiRuTian submitted a pull request that requires signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before it can be reviewed or merged; the project team requests the contributor to sign the CLA via a provided link. The pull request aims to introduce a micro-optimization, particularly relevant for SSR-first frameworks like Next.js, suggesting potential size reductions or performance improvements. Reviewers @acdlite, @gnoff, @sebmarkbage, and @eps1lon are asked to examine the PR, indicating that it may involve core or advanced code changes. Additionally, there is an automated check noting that size differences are significant, prompting further analysis of the impact. Overall, the discussions focus on ensuring licensing compliance and assessing the benefits of the proposed optimization."
2025-04-20,facebook/react,"The primary technical concern revolves around the attribute order in JSX, particularly how React handles the `crossOrigin` and `src` attributes on `<img>` tags, with inconsistencies impacting CORS behavior and security. There is also significant discussion about React's handling of native HTML elements like `<dialog>`, especially regarding the `autoFocus` attribute, which doesn't reliably trigger focus due to React's internal logic and recent bugs in React 18.2.0, prompting workarounds involving manual focus management with refs and timeouts. Unresolved questions include whether React should preserve attribute order for attributes like `crossOrigin`, and how to reliably implement `autoFocus` in dialogs across React versions. Additionally, there are ongoing issues with rendering behaviors such as `renderToString` in React 19, and general community frustration over delayed bug fixes and lack of clear guidance."
2025-04-21,facebook/react,"The discussions touch on performance optimizations, with one contributor proposing a regex-based string replacement for potential efficiency gains, but reviewers emphasize the need for comprehensive benchmarks, especially across realistic, varied string data, before changing the current implementation. There is a concern regarding robust handling of unknown actions in a reducer, with a suggestion to add a default case to prevent returning undefined, which could cause runtime errors. Multiple size comparison reports indicate no significant or critical changes in production bundle sizes across different builds, suggesting stability in release overhead. Additionally, there's a request to avoid using the React repository for practice, implying a preference for contributing to production code rather than experimental or personal projects. Unresolved questions include the necessity of empirical performance data to justify the proposed regex optimization and the importance of default case handling in reducers for more predictable React behavior."
2025-04-22,facebook/react,"The primary concern across these discussions is that controlled `<select>` elements, when managed with `useActionState`, tend to reset to default or previous values after form submission, unlike `<input>` elements which behave as expected. Multiple users report that relying on `defaultValue` and avoiding `value`/`onChange` pairing helps maintain the selected option, indicating a potential bug in React 19's handling of controlled components with `useActionState`. Several proposed workarounds involve resetting local state with `useEffect` or forcing a re-mount with a `key` prop, suggesting the root issue may be related to React's internal state synchronization of controlled components after async updates. There is discussion about whether this is a React bug or an unintended side effect of the internal implementation, with some indicating it might be a React 19-specific regression. Unresolved questions remain about the best pattern to manage `<select>` components controlled with `useActionState`, especially when `value` and `onChange` are involved, and whether this behavior is intended or warrants a fix."
2025-04-23,facebook/react,"The discussions primarily revolve around React's handling of controlled versus uncontrolled components, especially with inputs like `<input>` and `<select>`, highlighting issues with `undefined` values triggering warnings or unintended resets. Several contributors suggest workarounds such as using `null`, `''`, or wrapping values in objects, along with proposals for new APIs or patterns to explicitly manage controlled states without triggering warnings. There's concern about the rigidity of React's deprecation of `defaultProps` and how to support controlled components with `undefined` values, particularly in forms managed by hooks like `useActionState` or integrating with form libraries. Additionally, questions about the internal React implementation and the possibility of disabling certain warnings point to a broader challenge of balancing user experience and internal consistency. Unresolved questions include how to seamlessly support `undefined` as a valid initial or interim value without warnings or resets, and whether new APIs or patterns should be adopted to better manage controlled/uncontrolled states in modern React."
