2017-11-21 00:00:00,"Electronic Arts' stock has increased by 150% over three years, driven by in-game spending growth, but recent controversy over microtransactions in Star Wars: Battlefront 2 caused the company to suspend in-game purchases temporarily.

The controversy highlights a broader industry shift toward monetizing games through ongoing in-game content sales, a model increasingly adopted by major companies like Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard. While this strategy introduces risks related to consumer perception, it is deemed necessary due to rising development costs and the need for continuous revenue streams.
