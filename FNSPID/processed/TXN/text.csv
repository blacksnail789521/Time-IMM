2014-05-07 00:00:00,"In 2012, Micron Technology's revenue and profitability declined due to macroeconomic weakness, oversupply, and falling memory prices, but it rebounded in 2013 driven by industry consolidation, increased demand from non-PC markets, and higher memory prices. DRAM prices, having fallen sharply in 2011 and 2012 due to excess capacity, increased roughly 10% in 2013 as demand from high-growth segments absorbed supply, though prices are expected to decline at a slower rate moving forward. Factors such as shifted manufacturing capacities from PCs to mobile and embedded systems, supply disruptions from events like earthquakes and factory fires, and inventory build-up by buyers have contributed to recent price stabilization and increases. However, technical and industry dynamics suggest that, as supply normalization occurs, DRAM prices may decline again, especially with rising mobile DRAM usage which tends to have lower prices.

The company's valuation metrics, including a P/S ratio that has risen to 8.2x this year, suggest further downside potential if market conditions worsen, with a projected stock decline to about $90 if the P/S ratio falls to 7.5x. Financially, Xilinx experienced a 15% revenue drop in Q1 2020 and a significant decline in EPS, with revenues and margins likely to remain under pressure in the near term.

The stock's P/E ratio increased from 16x in 2018 to 29x this year, but there is potential downside if demand remains weak and the P/E ratio declines to pre-Covid levels, which could reduce the stock price to around $125—a nearly 20% drop from current levels. The weak Q2 2020 earnings, driven by COVID-19's impact on industrial and automotive sectors, suggest that revenues and operating margins may face further pressure in the near term.
