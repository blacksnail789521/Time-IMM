In the U.S., Berkeley's penny-per-ounce soda tax generated only $116,000 in its first month and was often underpassed by vendors, highlighting challenges in tax implementation. As soda consumption declines, major companies like Coke and Pepsi are diversifying into non-soda businesses, including investments in beverage and food brands.

2016-01-22 00:00:00,"The article discusses a options trading strategy involving selling put contracts for PepsiCo (PEP) shares, specifically the January 2018 put at the $55 strike with a bid of $1.17, offering a 1.1% annualized return. Selling the put provides income from the premium but limits upside potential, as the seller only benefits if the stock price remains above $55. The current stock price is $95.42, significantly above the strike, and PepsiCo's 12-month volatility is 16%. The market shows heightened put option activity with a put-to-call ratio of 0.83, indicating increased bearish sentiment among options traders. This strategy's risk is that the stock could decline more than 42.2%, potentially resulting in buying shares at a lower cost basis but with no upside beyond the premium collected.",PEP

These taxes, which often target both full-calorie and diet sodas, aim to reduce consumption and generate revenue; for example, Cook County's proposed tax could raise soda prices by 70%. Despite concerns, the impact of such taxes on major soda companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsi may be limited, as soda sales are already declining and companies are diversifying into healthier products. Additionally, the effectiveness of local soda taxes might be mitigated by consumers purchasing in neighboring areas with no taxes. Overall, while soda tax measures are gaining traction, their influence on the financial performance of beverage corporations appears to be moderate at this stage.",PEP

Despite the company's lack of detailed sales disclosure for La Croix, its rapid growth has led analysts to raise its price target to $150, reflecting a potential 40% gain from current levels, but also raising concerns about valuation due to a high P/E ratio of 42.5. Analyst Pablo Zuanic incorporates a 25% chance of a buyout, estimating a valuation of around $6.8 billion or $148 per share, assuming La Croix continues to dominate and the rest of the company sells at a lower multiple.
