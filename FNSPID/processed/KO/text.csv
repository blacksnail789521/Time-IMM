2016-04-15 00:00:00,"PepsiCo (PEP) has outperformed Coca-Cola (KO) over the past five years with a 53% return compared to Coke's 35%. Both companies are dividend growers, with Pepsi up 43 years in a row and Coca-Cola 54, though Pepsi's current dividend yield (2.7%) nearly matches Coke's (3%). Despite declining sales—Pepsi's for five consecutive quarters and Coke's for three—Pepsi's diversified portfolio, including food and non-soda beverages, provides a growth advantage. Pepsi relies less on soda (~47% of sales) than Coca-Cola (~75%), which makes it potentially more resilient as soda sales decline globally.

Altria, in contrast, has successfully expanded internationally through its Philip Morris International spinoff and maintains a transparent dividend payout policy of 80% of adjusted earnings.

2018-03-25 00:00:00,"Warren Buffett measures Berkshire Hathaway's performance primarily through the change in book value per share rather than net income or sales, as book value captures earnings from operating companies, unrealized gains on investments, and profits from sales, providing a more comprehensive view of value creation. Unlike net income, which can be volatile and ignores unrealized gains, book value reflects the company's accumulated earnings and asset value, making it a preferred metric for Buffett. The article explains that the value of investments like Coca-Cola increases are only reflected in net income when sold but appear immediately in book value through fair value adjustments. Despite its usefulness, book value has limitations, especially as Berkshire shifts toward owning majority stakes in operating businesses, which may not be fully represented on the balance sheet. Overall, Buffett emphasizes the importance of book value as a performance measure, acknowledging it as a ""quick and dirty"" metric with some weaknesses.",KO

Valuations based on KDP's stock are estimated between $17 and $24 per share, implying a total DPS value of $120-$130, suggesting a 2%-8% upside from current levels. The analysis considers KDP's earnings, growth prospects, and dividend yields, estimating its fair value based on historical earnings multiples and dividend yields. Despite limited growth potential, DPS stock is viewed as undervalued, offering mild gains and downside protection.

Despite Buffett's preference for reinvesting profits, Berkshire benefits from steady dividend inflows that support its capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases, maintaining a cash reserve of $116 billion at the end of 2017. Buffett values these dividend payments from portfolio companies, even though Berkshire itself has historically not paid dividends.

Despite a long history of dividend payments and a 3.7% yield, the company's dividend sustainability is questionable as free cash flow allocated to dividends has exceeded 100%, indicating potential financial fragility. The company's market dominance appears to be waning, especially in Latin America and North America, with organic revenue growth driven mainly by price increases in Asia Pacific.
