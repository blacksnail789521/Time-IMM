Large estate owners, such as billionaires and wealthy landowners, are more likely to be liable for increased inheritance tax, especially estates valued above the threshold, potentially paying hundreds of millions. The change might influence rural property markets and could lead some large estates to sell farmland to cover tax bills, indirectly affecting tenants and smaller farmers. Tax relief provisions can significantly mitigate inheritance tax liabilities for farms worth several million pounds, especially for family-owned farms splitting assets among spouses. Overall, the policy aims to increase tax revenue from the wealthiest estate owners, with some opposition fearing it could impact future investment in high-productivity farming technologies."
