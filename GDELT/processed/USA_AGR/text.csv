2022-10-08 01:45:00,USA_AGR,"Several U.S. states, including Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and California, have lowered their overtime threshold for agricultural workers to 40 hours per week. New York has decided to implement this change by 2032, allowing farm workers to receive overtime pay after 40 hours, unlike the long-standing exemption under federal law. Advocates argue that this move promotes fairness and recognizes the value of workers' labor, whereas farmers claim it could increase costs and reduce work hours. The California law, phased in for farms of varying sizes, has not led to a decrease in work hours, and economic studies suggest the overall impact on farm wages and business stability has been minimal. Policymakers are providing tax credits to mitigate the financial burden on farmers as they adjust to the new overtime standards."

Bouchard Family Farm in Fort Kent will expand its gluten-free buckwheat flour processing and promote buckwheat as a crop rotation, while Maine Grains in Skowhegan will enhance infrastructure for grain extrusion to develop new cereal products and connect small producers to markets. The program aims to strengthen capacity within the supply chain and support regional farmers. Additionally, top US milling companies and upcoming industry events, such as the IAOM conference, highlight the importance of milling capacity and technology in the US agricultural sector."
2024-12-27 21:45:00,USA_AGR,"Arkansas farmers experienced a productive year for corn yields despite a 41% reduction in plantings due to lower market prices, with an expected harvest of 90.2 million bushels. Winter wheat and grain sorghum acreages remained limited, partly because of market access issues and lower profit potential, with sorghum acres stable at around 12,000 and wheat planting down 43% from last year. Corn planting decreased mainly due to high input costs, particularly fertilizers and seed, combined with less favorable prices, leading to crop shifts toward soybeans. Favorable weather, including timely rains and early planting, contributed to strong corn yields in northeastern Arkansas. Research supported by the Arkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum Checkoff Program has helped improve corn yields over the past 25 years through advancements in planting and irrigation practices."

2024-12-28 17:15:00,USA_AGR,"In 2024, Arkansas farmers experienced near-record corn yields but planted about 41% fewer acres due to low market prices, with prices falling significantly from previous years. The state's winter wheat and grain sorghum industries faced challenges, including limited local markets and lower profits, resulting in reduced acreage for wheat by 43% and maintaining sorghum at around 12,000 acres. Despite favorable weather conditions and timely rains boosting corn yields, lower crop prices and high input costs, primarily for seed and fertilizer, influenced farmers to diversify their crops or reduce planting, especially for corn and wheat. The Arkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum Checkoff Program supports research to improve yields and crop practices. Overall, market prices, input costs, and limited local markets significantly impacted crop planting decisions in Arkansas."

The study involves 240 undergraduates who will eat beef and undergo various health and cognitive assessments over 12 weeks. The research aims to identify specific nutrients in beef that may promote brain aging delay and overall health. The project is supported by the Nebraska Beef Council, Texas Beef Council, and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. The study highlights ongoing efforts within the agriculture industry to connect beef production with health and nutritional benefits."

It describes volunteer efforts, such as annual workdays, to support and provide services to these farmworkers, many of whom may lack proper documentation. Vermont farmers recognize that these workers are essential for maintaining farm operations and preserving the landscape, with some farmers expressing deep appreciation for their contributions. The piece underscores the significance of immigrant labor in addressing labor shortages and sustaining agricultural productivity. Overall, it advocates for welcoming and supporting immigrant workers in the agricultural sector."
2024-12-31 14:30:00,USA_AGR,"Farmers relying on the Colorado River are alarmed as declining water flows threaten food supplies, especially in regions like California's Imperial Valley, which produces a significant portion of the nation's winter vegetables. Agriculture consumes around 80% of the river's water, and reduced levels, combined with limited rainfall and potential water agreement disputes, could lead to decreased crop diversity and higher grocery prices. Conservation efforts, including advanced irrigation and field leveling, are underway to reduce water usage. Reservoir levels such as Lake Powell and Lake Mead are dangerously low, jeopardizing the river's stability. The outcome of negotiations on the 2026 water-sharing agreement will significantly impact water availability and food production in the region."
